     <h3> Overview </h3>
     <p> The New Territory mission will help us understand worlds at the edge of our solar system by making the first human spaceflight to the Pluto system.</p>

     <h3> The Journey</h3>
     <p>New Territory will be launched on Jan. 19, 2026; it will swing past Jupiter for a gravity boost and scientific studies in February 2027, and will conduct a six-month-long reconnaissance flyby study of Pluto and its moons that started in early 2035. Pluto closest approach will occur on July 14, 2035. Sending a manned spacecraft on this long journey is a huge challenge on the life support and the hybernation system.</p>

     <h3> New Science </h3>
     <p> Pluto and its largest moon, Charon, belong to a third category known as "ice dwarfs." They have solid surfaces but, unlike the terrestrial planets, a significant portion of their mass is icy material. A human landing on these planets promises to examine the sustainability of artificial life-support systems. New Territory is exploring – for the first time – how deep in the universe humans can reach.</p>
