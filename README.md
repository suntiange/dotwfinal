## Drawing on the Web Final Project
[link to my page](http://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~ts2555/dotw/final-project/)

My final project will be three pages on a spaceship.  

Page 1
The first page will be the shape of a spaceship. 
This page will include:
* a rotatable 3-D spaceship
* created by WebGL custom shape
* the users will be able to rotate the shape and zoom in or out 
* the outline of the ship will be made up of grids and the ship will be transparent
* the shape will be rotating slowly by itself when the user opens the page

Page 2
The second page will be the view from the spaceship:
* the view will be able to change according to the speed of the ship 
* The window of the spaceship will be done by SVG
* The user will be able to control the speed of the ship (the speed ranges from 0 to 1/2 c)
* When the speed equals 0, the view would be a static image of stars (no specific planet). 
* As the ship accelerates, the starts will turn from dots to lines. The higher the speed of the ship, the longer the lines. 

Page 3
The route of the space ship in solar system 
* The route will be from the Earth to Pluto. 
* Each planet in the solar system will be moving with their own speed. 
* the page will look like an animated flying route on flights
